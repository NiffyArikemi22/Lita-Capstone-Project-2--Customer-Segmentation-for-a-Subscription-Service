# Lita-Capstone-Project-2--Customer-Segmentation-for-a-Subscription-Service

### Project Overview
This repository demonstrates a Power BI solution that integrates data from both an Excel Pivot Table and an SQL Database to visualize and analyze customer subscription trends, segmentation, and cancellations. The dashboard uses slicers for interactive analysis, and the data sources are cleaned and transformed for deeper insights. This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify segments and trends. The goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription types, and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals. The final deliverable is a Power BI dashboard that presents the analysis.

### Dataset Structure
The dataset used in this dashboard contains the following columns:

- CustomerID: Unique identifier for the customer.
- CustomerName: The name of the customer.
- Region: The geographic region the customer belongs to.
- SubscriptionType: Type of subscription the customer has (e.g., Basic, Premium, Standard).
- SubscriptionStart: The start date of the customer’s subscription.
- SubscriptionEnd: The end date of the customer’s subscription.
- Canceled: Boolean flag indicating whether the subscription was canceled (True/False).
- Revenue: The revenue generated from the subscription.

### Tool Used
- Excel Function: Used for data cleaning (removing duplicates) and summarizing the data using pivot tables
- SQL: Performed data analysis and created views for generating insights
- PowerBI: Used to visualize the finding through interactive dashboards.

### Dataset File
- Excel File:
